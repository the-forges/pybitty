# pybitty
Bitty is a memory unit conversion python module that makes working with multiple sizes and SI/IEC standards straight forward. It is based on unit ecapsulation, immutability, plugability, and testability: the idea that each unit should know how to operate with other valid units idempotently; every unit function returns a new unit or value, instead of changing itself; each unit implements interfaces so that it's easy to plug in new unit types (which also makes testing new unit types straight forward).
